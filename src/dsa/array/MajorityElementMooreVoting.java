/*
* This class is using Moore Voting algorithm described below
* https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/best-ideas/mjrty/index.html
* It results in element that could be majority but not in all cases. So it need to be verified by second pass.
* But there is no other element be majoiry other than provided by this algorithm.
* It provides majority by n/k where n is total elements and k is total majority element
*
* It is streaming algorithm. Hence could be used with streaming of elements.
